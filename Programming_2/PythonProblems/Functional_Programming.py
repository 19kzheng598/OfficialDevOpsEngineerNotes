"""Sets

The union operator | combines two sets to form a new one containing items in either.
The intersection operator & gets items only in both.
The difference operator - gets items in the first set but not in the second.
The symmetric difference operator ^ gets items in either set, but not both.
x.add() adds an item to the set
x.remove() removes a item from the set
x.pop() removes a arbitrary element

Sets are created using curly braces and they hold unique values.

Given two sets, find and output all the elements that are common to both sets.
For example, for the following sets:
{'a', 'b', 'c'}
{'c', 'd', 'e'}

The output should be {'c'}, as it is present in both sets."""
