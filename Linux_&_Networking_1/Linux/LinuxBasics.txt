Q: can you combine multiple tags together and commands
S: yes you can combine multiple tags as long as there is a space between each tag and yes you can combine commands by using the pipeline operator
the [command1] | [command2] command1 outputs first then command2 outputs next

Q:What is a CLI?
S:A text-based program that performs actions via commands and interacts with the kernel
which the kernel interacts with the hardware to perform tasks on the computer.

Q:What is a shell?
S:A shell is a program that runs commands from CLIs or built-in and outputs results. It is one of the most
important parts of a Unix system. There are many different Unix shells but all derive features from the Bourne shell aka
/bin/shell

Q:What is a terminal?
S:A GUI program used to run a shell such as windows terminal iTerm2 or Guake

Q:What is a shell script?
S:A text file that contains a sequence of shell commands.

Q:What is bash?
S:Linux uses an enhanced version of the Bourne Shell called Bash. Bash stands for Bourne Again Shell and it's become the Defacto standard
for managing Linux machines

Q:Syntax of Bash commands?
S:command [options] [arguments]

Q:How to get help on commands?
S:
man [command]
or [command] --help

Q:Wildcards(metacharacters)?
S: Symbols that represent one or more characters in bash commands such as,

- represents zero or a sequence of characters
  ? represents a single character
  [] denotes a group of characters

Q:Commands to explore for the basics
S:
ls lists the contents of the current directory or specified directory

ls -a include hidden files and directories

ls -l include more information about each file

pwd print the path to your current working directory

cat concatenate files to standard output. fancy way of saying display the contents of a file to the screen

man get the documentation on a command

cd stands for change directory, get help with man builtins.

cd .. move out of a current directory

cd ~ go to the home directory

mkdir create a directory

mkdir -p to make a subdirectory or multiple sub directories

rmdir delete an empty directory

rm delete a file

rm -i pops a prompt to confirm deletion

rm -r

rm \ delete all files (ignore the slash my prettier plugin on vscode is being stupid and I don't have time to fix it)

cp copy files and directories

ps get a snapshot of all currently running processes

sudo some commands can only be run by the root user (aka superuser) you don't want to login as the root user because
You have no record of system-altering commands or who is performing them and you don't have access to your normal shell
environment.

Q: Redirection?
S: I/O redirection allows us to redirect input and output of commands to and from files, as well as connect multiple commands together into pipelines.
< for redirecting input to a source other than the keyboard

> for redirecting output to destination other than the screen and overwrites whatever is in the file

> > for doing the same, but appending rather than overwriting

| for piping output from one command to the input of another

Q:Redirecting standard error or stderr 2 is standard error where 1 is the output stream.
S:ls -l /bin/usr 2> file_name.txt

Q:Redirecting standard output and standard error to one file in newer versions of bash you can use just &
S: ls -l /bin/usr > ls-output.txt 2>&1
or
ls -l /bin/usr &> ls-output.txt

Q:Redirecting standard input. Essentially this takes a file's content and then uses that file as standard in instead of you typing out stuff
S:cat < file_name.txt

Q:To chain commands use pipelines.
S:ls -l /usr/bin | less
or
ps -ef | grep daemon
or
cat file.xtxt | fmt | pr | lpr

Q:Terminating a misbehaving process.
S:

1.  #create the program with vi:

    vi bad.py

#insert the following which is a python code that lasts forever:

i = 0
while i == 0:
pass

2.  #Start the program put this in the command:

bash python3 bad.py &

#The & tells bash to run the command in the background and not wait for it to finish

3.  #let's list all the process that contain "python":

ps -ef | grep python

#ps lists the running processes in the background
-e shows all the processes
-f lists in full format listing
-ef is the combined of the two above

4. #Final step to end the program:

#This lists all the commands for kill

kill -l

5. #We have to decide which signal we are going to send kill the default is TERM allows the process to safely shut down.

ps #to view the IDs of the current directory
kill -9 PROCESS_ID

Q:Use bash and grep(global regular expression print) to filter CLI output. Let's use Linux's universal pattern-matching program grep to filter Azure CLI output
S: s2 -o table | awk '{print 3}' | grep 'DS.\*\_v2'

Q:More about grep
S:-i for case-insensitive matches
-v inverts the search and prints lines that don't match

#regular expressions are an entire topic but the three important things to remember are

.\* matches any number of characters including none.

.+ matches any one or more characters.

. matches exactly one arbitrary character
